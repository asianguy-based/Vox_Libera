# Augmentative and Alternative Communications (AAC) app for everyone!

This application was written with the goal of ensuring that everyone with a disability, even those without, can are afforded the opportunity to speak.

For those that can speak, we often take this free ability for granted. That is why this application is available at NO COST to all. There shouldn't be a price on the ability to speak!

To utilize this application, visit https://vox-libera-408583195940.us-west1.run.app/.

At this time, it is in beta mode and there may be some issues. If there is an issue, concern, or feature to be added, I can be reached at my email address in the app. 

I am one person trying to do what I can. Having a daughter with Cerebral Palsy, I know how these AAC apps are. One has features that another has but it costs a lot of money or vice versa and it is often hard to chose. Why not design something that is useful for EVERYONE!

If you can, please show your support and check out another project of mine:
